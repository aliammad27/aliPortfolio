                    <p class="description">
                        During my pre-dental studies at the University of Pittsburgh, I was eagerly gearing up for a career in dentistry. Yet, amidst the rigor of my scientific pursuits, I stumbled upon the world of computer science, which unexpectedly ignited my interest. It was the prospect of creating an app for the Brighter Smile Foundation, a nonprofit endeavor I initiated, that truly sparked my fascination with computer science and its potential for making a tangible difference in people's lives. Amidst my scientific pursuits, I discerned a craving for intellectual stimulation of a different nature. Although scientific curiosity was something I was constantly surrounded by, coding, problem solving, and the broader realm of technology began to captivate my attention even more. This eclipsed my initial focus on dentistry. During a summer internship at a dental clinic, while I valued the hands on aspects of dentistry, it was the integration of technology that truly ignited my passion. This realization also led me to switch gears toward computer science, a decision filled with both apprehension and excitement. Now immersed in the world of programming languages and honing my problem solving acumen, I am intrigued by the unlimited possibilities inherent in this new pursuit. Yet, even as I shift my focus to the world of computer science, I remain unwavering in my dedication to the Brighter Smile Foundation. Committed to extending oral health education and accessibility to underserved communities, this mission remains close to my heart. I am now eager to integrate my newfound skills in computer science into the foundation's initiatives, leveraging technology to enhance our impact and reach. As I embark on this new chapter, armed with a fervor for science, a burgeoning affinity for code, and an unwavering dedication to social impact, I am poised to effect meaningful change at the intersection of healthcare and technology.
